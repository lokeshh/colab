I am a student. I really love herokuapps. They are helping me for deploying my projects. Recently I purchased a custom domain with namecheap.com, to redirect it to one of my apps. Now while creating a custom domain for my app, I am getting error message asking me to verify my account by entering credit card.
My question is would you charge anything if I give my credit card. And if you could verify my acount by any other means, I would be utmost greatful to you.

Thanks for listening and I love heroku.com
